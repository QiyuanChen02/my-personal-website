                <p>Out of all the hobbies on the list, I think this may be the most useful one of them all, since I'm also planning on studying computer science at Uni in addition to maths. Obviously I know HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT (how else would I have made this website?) but I have also know some Python, having made the original Snake Game using Python and Pygame. Furthermore I've created an Excel program which automatically generates arithmetic maths questions to complete and then marks them.</p>

                <p>What's unfortunate is that most of my old programs, including those I've described above have been lost since I changed computer without transferring the files. However that won't stop me from planning to create many more cool projects to replace them in the future, which I believe will both develop my technical skills and my creativity.</p>

                <p>Chess was another hobby I picked up at a young age, when I friend I had in year 1 introduced me to it. I have fond memories of playing many games against him, even though the quality of our games probably wasn't very high. I think we were blundering queens here and there. From there I developed my skill by reading chess books, watching tutorial videos and analysing my games, slowly getting better and better.</p>

                <p>I took part in the Braunstone Chess Club at the age of 10, taking part in chess lessons and playing many tournaments with them. I think that was when I peaked in skill, becoming the best under-13 chess player in Leicester. Unfortunately I moved to birmingham to go to my new secondary school, and I had to leave the chess club. Since then, I've not really improved much in chess. I'm still decent, but these days I prefer playing chess recreationally against my chessmates or against random opponents online in blitz games.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Piano was one of the hobbies my parents initially forced me to do. From the age of 7 I attended piano lessons weekly, having to practise up to half an hour per day. Slowly I passed through the grades slowly, finally achieving a grade 8 at 11 and a ARSM diploma at 13. To tell the truth, I didn't originally enjoy spending hours learning the set pieces and scales, but now I'm grateful that I got this opportunity to develop my musical skills. For example, I can now pick up most piano pieces with relative ease, and perform for my family and friends.</p>

                <h4>Flute</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="hobbiesContent">
                <br>
                <p>I picked up flute just a bit after piano, even though this more through own choice rather than my parents. Having recently also achieved a diploma in it, I look back and realise just how much this hobby has enriched my life. In school, this allowed me to join multiple ensembles such as the Concert Orchestra, Concert Band, Flute Choir and Wind Quintet. Every year performing in 3 school concerts, and even once in a local church.</p>

                <p>Not only that, but I take part in orchestras outside of school too. For example I'm been in the Birmingham Schools Wind Orchestra (BSWO) and the Birmingham Schools Symphony Orchestra (BSSO). There, I take pride in performing for hundreds of people after months of rehearsals and practice on difficult ensemble pieces. One of my most memorable life experiences is actually going on the Czech tour with the BSWO, exploring famous places in Prague and performing for a foreign audience.</p>

                <h4>Juggling</h4>

            <div class="hobbiesContent">
                <br>
                <p>As someone who's never been known to be good as sports or have good hand eye co-ordination, I didn't expect to be good at juggling. But we had some juggling balls lying around in the house, so in year 12 I thought, "hey, why not at least try it?" Surprising it turned out easier than expected. After consistent practise over a week, I managed to juggle 3 balls. I didn't just stop there though, I started learning more complex juggling tricks like Mills-Mess and Windmill. Now I can juggle up to 4 balls and I've amassed over 15 different 3 ball juggling tricks.</p>

                <h4>Cubing</h4>
            </div>

            <div class="hobbiesContent">
                <br>
                <p>When I was in year 5, at just the age of 9, I was first able to solve a rubik's cube. Of course, I brought it in and showed all my friends to try and impress them. Anyways, I kind of dropped cubing soon after, until just after my GCSEs. I realised I suddenly had a lot of free time, so I decided, why not try and solve the Rubik's cube again?</p>
            
                <p>And that how I found out about speedcubing, which is just the act of trying to solve a Rubik's cube as fast as possible. By following tutorials from JPerm, I managed to learn advanced methods such as F2L and PLL which allowed me to slowly reduce my time. It was extremely satisfying seeing my faster solve time drop from 2 minutes to 1 minute to 30 seconds all the way down to just under 15 seconds right now (14.94s).</p>

            <div class="hobbiesContent">
                <br>
                <p>Reading is a hobby which waxes and wanes. Sometimes I read a lot and other times I don't really read much, depending on busy I am in life and whether or not I've found a book that interestes me. My favorite fantasy series is probably The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson. The magic systems and the worldbuilding is fantastic and I'm so attached to some of the characters that I'm not afraid to admit that I teared up at some of the moments.</p>

                <p>I also read non-fiction too, mostly to find ways to constantly improve my life and way of thinking. For example I've tried reading Atomic Habits, in order to try to make habits and stick to them, or the power of sleep, to try and improve my sleep schedule. Not just that, but through books like Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman or The 4-Hour Workweek, I feel like I've been able to explore the lives and thoughts of scientists and entrepreneurs alike. After all, a reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, a man who never reads lives only one.</p>
