            <h3>Why making a website is easier than you think</h3>
            <br>

            <p>There are many reasons why you may want to create a website. However, I get the feeling that most people who want to build one actually fall under the impression that it's really difficult to do, and that you need to have a lot of experience with programming to do so. I certainly did back then. Sure, if you want to build the next Google or the next Youtube, you wouldn't be wrong. However, if the end goal is something a useful online tool or your personal website to introduce yourself and get your thoughts across, the amount of learning required to do so is actually much less than expected. Follow these few steps underlined below, and you'll have a simple website up in no time.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Learn HTML</li>
                <li>Learn CSS</li>
                <li>Download a code editor (optional)</li>
                <li>Practice</li>
                <li>Make and host your website</li>
                <li>Continue in your coding journey</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Step 1 - Learn HTML</h5>
            <p>HTML is like the skeleton of a website, the backbone to which you add everything else. This includes the page titles, the main website content and links to other areas of the web. HTML tutorials are everywhere on the Internet, so finding one shouldn't be much of a problem. Personally, I recommend <a href="http://codeacademy.com">codeacademy.com</a> or <a href="http://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a>. I found both of these extremely useful, as you learn coding by actually doing the coding yourself, instead of just following a tutorial. There's a sidebar that basically guides you through the entire process, with your code constantly being checked to make sure you're doing everything right. Just work through all the interactive guides and by the end of it, you'll come out with a working grasp of HTML.</p>
            <h5>Step 2 - Learn CSS</h5>
            <p>If HTML is the skeleton of the website, CSS is like the muscles, organs and skin of the website. This is the part where you position and colour all the text and backgrounds of a website to make it look cool. Again, the simplest way to learn this is to just use the interactive tutorials in <a href="http://codeacademy.com">codeacademy.com</a> or <a href="http://freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a>. Pay special attention to the box model in CSS (you'll know what that is once you get to it). This is possibly the most important part to understand and once you understand it, most of the rest of CSS is pretty simple.</p>
            <h5>Step 3 - Download a code editor (optional)</h5>
            <p>There is no one saying you have to download a code editor when building a website. In fact, theoretically, you could code the whole internet in just Notepad! Still, a code editor can do wonders in making code faster to write and much clearer with lots of helpful features. Personally, I recommend using Visual Studio Code which you can download at <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"></a><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">code.visualstudio.com</a>.</p>
            <h5>Step 4 - Practice</h5>
            <p>Now with HTML and CSS, you now have the ability to make your own websites all by yourself now. &nbsp;Just create your own index.html page and start coding whatever you want. Let your creative juices flow. However, I still recommend starting with simple programs (e.g a single page to describe a hobby you enjoy for example) to build up some experience. This step is crucial. Trying to become a good programmer without practising by coding yourself is like trying to become a good mathematician without solving maths problems or trying to be a musician without practising your instrument. Messing around with trying code and failing is how you develop most of your fluency with HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h5>Step 5 - Make and host your website</h5>
            <p>Now you have all the skills you require, so now go out there and make whatever simple website you want! If you want to, you can then host your website for everyone else to see and use. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/"></a><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify.com</a> is a nice way to do this (from the domain name, you can see I'm still using it now), as all you have to do is to make an account and upload your files. It's simple and best of all, completely free to do.</p>
            <h5>Step 6 - Continue in your coding journey</h5>
            <p>Why stop there? Now you've learnt to use HTML and CSS and made your first website, there are far more doors open to you. Most importantly, I'd suggest first learning Javascript, in order to start making your websites interactive. Then what you learn next completely depends on you. There's a wide range of choices from Bootstrap to JQuery to React JS and far more. Explore your options and enjoy yourself.</p>
            <h5>Endnote</h5>
            <p>This is the path I took for web development, so if you follow this, I'm confident you'll be able to make some cool projects like me in your free time. If anyone manages to actually make an online website using this quick guide, send the link address to me and I'll make sure to have a look at it.</p>
