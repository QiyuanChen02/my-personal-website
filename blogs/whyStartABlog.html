            <h3>Why start a blog?</h3>
            <br>

            <p>I'm not going to lie, even just a single week ago, the idea of starting a blog was completely alien to me. I mean, what's the point of writing about doing something, when you could just do it instead? After all, you would have to dedicate a lot of time to blogging and even then there's a good chance you wouldn't be able to make any money from it. Well, yes, those points are all somewhat true, but here are some reasons I think you should start blogging anyway.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Developing your skills</li>
                <li>Increases motivation in actually doing something</li>
                <li>Networking and starting a community</li>
                <li>Helping others</li>
                <li>People want to see the struggles</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>Developing your skills</h5>
            <p>I firmly just putting pen to paper (or in this case, fingers to the keyboard) and writing whatever interests you is the best way to develop your communication skills. Through writing, you can really learn how to 'sell yourself', learning to talk about yourself in a way that brings across your personality and shows your skills. Being good at freely talking about what you do and enjoy will give you the key skills to not only ace any interviews but also to make long-lasting friendships in the future.</p>
            <h5>Increasing motivation in actually doing something</h5>
            <p>Do you ever get the feeling you can't be bothered to actually do anything? If you don't, then I don't believe you're actually human. For me, that feeling occurs at least once a week, and usually more and I think one of the reasons is the fact that very few people are supporting you in what you're doing.</p>
            <p>Why bother drawing a piece of art, if nobody's going to see it? Why bother writing a book, if nobody's going to read it? In a way, for me, it's the same with anything I do in life. Having other's see the effort you put in to mastering a skill or making a game is highly effective in motivating you. Just knowing that your effort is seen and really does make a difference in someone else's life is a great incentive to actually do something.</p>
            <h5>Networking and starting a community</h5>
            <p>Sharing what you believe to be interesting can be very valuable to others who may have the same interests as you, and cause them to become part of your community. I can see this as a nice way to connect with different people all around the world, giving you many more opportunities. Who knows, maybe one day, someone who knows you from your blog ends up deciding to contact you to work in his business.</p>
            <h5>Helping others</h5>
            <p>As the common saying goes, doing good makes us feel good. So that's why I want to play my part in helping others. By sharing all the information that I know out there, maybe it can help others who are struggling with the same problems or need that extra burst of motivation in order to make a U-turn in their lives. I believe everyone (to varying degrees!) has a small part of themselves that just want to help people, and writing a blog is a very good way to do so</p>
            <h5>People want to see your struggles</h5>
            <p>When readers review a character in a non-fiction book, notice what they all look for. Most of the time they don't care too much about what they end up achieving, such as the main character toppling an empire or destroying an evil wizard. Most of the time they care much more about the journey the characters go through. The sacrifices that they make. The struggles that they face. The desperation that pushes them to succeed in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>
            <p>That's what I see writing a blog as. A document sharing parts of your own journey. In my opinion, it's important to try to achieve something meaningful in life. However, I feel that it's equally important to share your own sacrifices, your own struggles and your own successes in overcoming them to result in your own achievements, something which can inspire people in a future generation.</p>
            <h5>Endnote</h5>
            <p>And that concludes the reasons why I think everyone should try to start a blog. Of course, take this advice with a grain of salt, since this is, after all, the first blog I've ever written! Maybe my opinions of blogging would completely change after doing it for some time. If you want to find out more, I highly suggest reading 'Show Your Work' by Austin Kleon.</p>
